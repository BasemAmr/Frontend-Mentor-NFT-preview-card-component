## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to use css box shadow properly as it was a great pain for me to learn, and got used on CSS Variables, too.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me for remembering all I wanted to remember about the property.
